if you want those folder to connect with git you can use
git init

now 2nd step is nameing origin
git remote add orgin <link>
you can check remote using git remote -v



to check branch
git branch
to give new name 
git branch -m branchname
to create new branch
git checkout -b <new branch name>
to go from one to another branch
git checkout <branch name>
to delete branch
git checkout -d <branch name>
